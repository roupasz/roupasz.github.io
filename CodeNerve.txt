Hello World! I am Zois Roupas and this is a short introduction.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>

My favorite quote is, "<span id="k">The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<p> At the moment I am working as a DevOps Engineer, planning and deploying infrastructure on-premise, in the cloud, and in hybrid situations! I have worked mainly in Insurance and Telecommunication companies as a Systems & Database Design Engineer.</p>

<p> I'm always trying to combine creativity with engineering and develop different projects in order to gain more knowledge on trending technologies and currently I'm experimenting with Docker, Kubernetes and Automation Tools like Ansible and Puppet!<!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj --><br />You can learn more by visiting my personal <a href="https://zroupas.github.io" target="_blank">Playground</a>!</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->

<p> In my free time I play Bass Guitar and I like to attend live concerts of my favourite bands. I'm watching a lot of series and movies, reading science fiction books and collecting all short of stuff from board games to vinyls and action figures!</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
